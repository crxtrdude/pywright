Special variables:
(This file is VERY incomplete, but there is some good info here. It
will be wrapped into better docs as they are written.)


Music
-----
Related commands: mus

'_music_loop'
    Music can be made to play an intro track and then loop a different
track. When music is played with the 'mus' command, the looping variable
is set to the track that was played. If you then set the looping variable
to a different track, once the current track finishes it will loop the one that
was set. 

'_music_fade'
    The volume level of music can be adjusted by changing this variable.
Valid levels are from '0' which means music can't be heard, to 100 which
is full volume. The variable has an effect even if changed while music is
playing. Note that the volume a player hears is also affected by their
music volume setting.


Saved Games
-------------
Related commands: savegame, loadgame

    You can disallow the player from saving or loading the game with
'set _allow_saveload off'. The menus will no longer come up when the
player hits the hotkeys. If your wrightscript calls the savegame or
loadgame functions which fire off a direct save or load action, the
value of _allow_saveload will not be referenced (savegame will
always work).

    You can also 'set _allow_autosave off' to turn the autosave function
off during the game. If you have a section in your game where you
do not want the player to save, you should turn both of these
variables off.

    Be VERY careful to remember to turn them back on again, or
players will no longer be able to save!


Characters
----------
Related commands: char, textbox (""), nt, emo

=controlling who is speaking=

_speaking:
    - gportrait (core/core.py 639)
    - add_portrait (core/core.py 659)
    - add_portrait (core/core.py 669)
    - _emo (core/libengine.py 1685)
    - _nt (core/libengine.py 2099)
   class DebugScript - call_func (core/libengine.py 2565)
   
_speaking_name:
    -  (core/libengine.py 1674)
    - _nt (core/libengine.py 2100)
   class DebugScript - call_func (core/libengine.py 2564)

    The variables '_speaking', and '_speaking name' determine which onscreen character
will animate when a textbox is printing characters, and what the textbox considers
that characters name. When the char command adds a character to the screen,
such as 'char mia nametag=Sarah', these variables are automatically set, so most
of the time you don't have to deal with them. 

    The '_speaking' variable will contain wrightscript identifier of the sprite, in this case 
it will be 'mia'. If you had a line like 'char mia name=char1' then the 'speaking' variable
would be char1. The '_speaking_name' variable, on the other hand, will be set to
the nametag, the name which is displayed to the player. In the first example, then,
_speaking_name would be set to "Sarah".

    These variables can be useful if you want to create a command which affects the
currently speaking character. Let's say your game has this contrived effect, which
happens often enough that you want to simplify the process. The effect is, the currently
speaking character will shift to the left side of the screen, and a little bio image with
some stats comes in from the right. Sort of a character introduction card, with some
stats about them.

    To achieve this effect, and make it repeatable, you want to create a macro. To
shift the currently speaking character to the left, you would use this command:
'scroll name=$_speaking x=-50'. The '$_speaking' for the name argument of the scroll,
will be replaced by the wrightscript name of the currently speaking character, so no
matter where your macro is used, it will always have the same effect.

    Another use of _speaking, is in the situation where you have more than one
character on screen at a time. You can have the two (or more!) characters talk
back and forth to each other by changing the value of _speaking after each line:

char phoenix x=-50
char mia x=100 stack
set _speaking phoenix
"Mia, we really need to figure out why the security card was dropped."
set _speaking mia
"Yes, that is true. I am inclined to agree that it was no accident that we found it."

    The '_speaking_name' variable has NO in game effect, but you can use it 
in certain cases if you (as the programmer) need to know what their nametag is
set to. Let's say you make a simple function to repeat a cliche line that you
want to reuse at many places in your case. You want the character to say
this: "Or my name isn't Bob!" Here is a macro that uses _speaking_name to
accomplish this:

macro cliche
"Or my name isn't {$_speaking_name}!"
endmacro

And here is how it might be used:

char mia
"Well, they had better fall at my feet when I wag my finger."
cliche

char phoenix
"Mia! Please let me try this case! I am ready!"
cliche


Animations
----------

'_default_port_frame_delay'
'_default_fg_frame_delay'
'_default_frame_delay'
    Initially set at core/macros/defaults.mcro in 'init_defaults' to 6 for all three variables.
    
    The value of these variables control how many game ticks to wait between frames of character animations,
fg animations, and all other animations. Animations themselves can set a specific frame delay with 
the 'framedelay' animation control command, and set a delay value for all frames with the 'globaldelay' 
animation control command. This variable defaults to 6, and probably should not be changed.

Text
----
Related commands: textbox (""), textblock

You can predefine colors by setting any variable named color_[name]
to a 3 digit number, or a 6 digit hexadecimal number. 

set color_red ff0000
"{c red}This text will be red"


Buttons
-------
Related commands: textbox(""), 

'_textbox_show_button'
    Every time a textbox appears, it will show a continue button on the
second screen, as long as this variable is true, which is the default behavior.
When a textbox continues, the continue button will also be erased. If you
want to prevent the continue button from being created when a textbox is,
'set _textbox_show_button false'. 

Important: Remember to set it to true again before returning to normal gameplay,
otherwise it could be invisible for the rest of the game!
